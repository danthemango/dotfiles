# dotfiles

This project will serve as a *hopefully* simple set up script to get new systems going, and to
keep old systems up to date.

No symlinking will be done. Instead, makefile targets will be used to update both the system, and the project dotfiles. The goal here is to be as fire and forget as possible, knowing that a total solution is not possible.
