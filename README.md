# dotfiles

This project will serve as a *hopefully* simple set up script to get new systems going, and to
keep old systems up to date.

# Usage
Type 'make help' for a full list of instructions

For copyright reasons, Fonts and background images will not be bundled with this repository and must be grabbed separately.

## Fonts
My dotfiles library assumes that [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) is installed, in the file urxvt/Xresources with line reading: 
URxvt\*font:			xft:Anonymous Pro:size=11

## Background Images
The background image is sourced from ~/.fehbg.jpg, so pick any picture you like and put it there. 
If not provided it will default to gray.

## Other
I also use [xcwd](https://github.com/schischi/xcwd), which is kind of useful.

# Who created this?
The vast majority of this code was taken from [Ojourmel](https://github.com/ojourmel) in 
[dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ojourmel/dotfiles), (much of which was copied from other great dotfiles) while the Xresources file came from [smjn's config repository](https://github.com/smjn/config)
