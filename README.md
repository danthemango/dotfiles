This project will serve as a *hopefully* simple set up script to get new systems going, and to
keep old systems up to date.

For copyright reasons, Fonts and background images will not be bundled with this repository and must be grabbed separately.

## Fonts
You can either install [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro), like I did, or change the file urxvt/Xresources with line reading "URxvt\*font:" with a font of your choice (or comment line out with !).

## Background Images
The background image is sourced from ~/.fehbg.jpg
If this is not provided it will default to gray.

# Who created this?
The vast majority of this code was created by [Ojourmel](https://github.com/ojourmel) in 
[dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ojourmel/dotfiles), while the Xresources file came from [smjn's config repository](https://github.com/smjn/config)
